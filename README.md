CamperShield: Mobile Application for Campers

Project Overview

CamperShield is a mobile application focusing on the Meemure Camping area designed to enhance the camping experience by providing tools to ensure safety and increase knowledge about the natural environment. 

The application helps campers identify 
Safe Bathing Spot Identification: Analyzes various factors such as water flow, water clarity, presence of wildlife, human footprints, and terrain type to determine the safety of natural water sources for bathing.
Animal Identification by Footprints: Uses image recognition to identify animals based on their footprints.
Animal Identification by Sounds: Utilizes audio analysis to recognize animals from recorded sounds.
Edible Mushroom Identification: Employs image recognition to determine whether mushrooms found in the wild are edible.
Tent Construction Knowledge and Skills

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing machine learning models.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning library for sound and image recognition models.
Flask: Web framework for creating the backend API.
React Native: Framework for building the mobile application.
Android/iOS: Platforms for mobile application deployment.


Model Training and Evaluation

Safe Bathing Spot Identification
Trained multiple classifiers including 
Random Forest
SVM
Decision Tree
KNN, and Gradient Boosting to predict the safety rating of water sources.

Future Work
Future improvements could include:

Collecting more data to improve model accuracy.
Incorporating additional features such as weather conditions and time of day.
