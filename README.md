<i>CamperShield: Mobile Application for Campers</i>

<h2><b>Project Overview</b></h2>

<p>CamperShield is a mobile application focusing on the "Meemure Camping area" designed to enhance the camping experience by providing tools to ensure safety and increase knowledge about the natural environment.</p>

<p>The application helps campers identify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Safe Bathing Spot Identification: Analyzes various factors such as water flow, water clarity, presence of wildlife, human footprints, and terrain type to determine the safety of natural water sources for bathing.</li>
  <li>Animal Identification by Footprints: Uses image recognition to identify animals based on their footprints.</li>
  <li>Animal Identification by Sounds: Utilizes audio analysis to recognize animals from recorded sounds.</li>
  <li>Edible Mushroom Identification: Employs image recognition to determine whether mushrooms found in the wild are edible.</li>
  <li>Tent Construction Knowledge and Skills</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Python: Programming language for implementing machine learning models.</li>
  <li>Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
  <li>TensorFlow/ Keras: Deep learning library for sound and image recognition models.</li>
  <li>Flask: Web framework for creating the backend API.</li>
  <li>React Native: Framework for building the mobile application.</li>
  <li>Android: Platforms for mobile application deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trained multiple classifiers including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>SVM</li>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>KNN</li>
  <li>Gradient Boosting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Work</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Collecting more data to improve model accuracy.</li>
  <li>Incorporating additional features such as weather conditions and time of day.</li>
</ul>
